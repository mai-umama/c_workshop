# Functions with C Programming

## Viewing Slide
To start the slide show:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`
- visit <http://localhost:3030>

### Code-runner
I used self-hosted instande of [judge0](https://github.com/judge0/judge0). The setup script is in `./setup/code-runner.ts`.
For stdin (command line input) write comments starting with `Input:`. example `// Input: 40`. do not put any other comment after inputs on the same line. everything after `input` keyword is assumed as input buffer.
